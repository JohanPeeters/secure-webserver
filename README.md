secure-webserver
================

This github repository contains a demonstration of setting up a HTTPS server with puppet. This is our experimentation environment that is used in the context of a talk at OWASP AppSec Research EU (https://appsec.eu). The presentation can be found at [google docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18SGzBhIrOdOmdgiox4gKUNuaLNpYZuFRFnhozRgw5fE/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).


This repository contains:
* [Vagrant definition of the virtual machines](Vagrantfile). This includes a set of scripts to get correct version of software on your machine (including puppet and openssl).
* [Puppet for configuration of an HTTPS server](production/modules). This puppet module could also be uploaded to a server and be run independently of Vagrant.
* [A script for installing Puppet on the Vagrant basebox](production/bootstrap.sh) as well as a couple of other things that we found hard to install with Puppet. We would like to whittle this down in the future.
* [A script to compile OpenSSL from source and turn it into a .deb package](production/install_openssl.sh). This takes a lot of time the first time the script is run in your environment. The package is cached, however, so the next time, it is a lot faster.
* [See above, but for Ruby](production/install_ruby-2.sh).
* [A script to construct a certificate request](production/prepare-certificate-request.sh). The resulting certificate request needs to be sent to a CA for signing if you want a public HTTPS site.
* [rspec tests](test/spec) that verify if the server configuration corresponds to expectations. 
* [Scripts to do certificate hocus-pocus](ca) inevitable when testing HTTPS configurations.
* [Scripted demo's](demo) showing off some of the features of the repo.
* [A simple script to invoke puppet](runpuppet.sh) - saves a lot of typing.
* [A simple script to run the tests](sanity-test.sh) - also to save key strokes.


Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting your experimentation with this you at least need

+ Git
+ Vagrant
+ VirtualBox

Getting started
-------

- Download the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/JohanPeeters/secure-webserver.git`

- Get the virtual machine up and running

`vagrant up prepuppet` for starting the virtual machine before running puppet. This sets up the basic virtual machine and installs necessary software until the puppet runtime. 

`vagrant up webserver` for starting the (full blown) webserver. This sets up nginx with a ssl with maximal security as we understand it and with one compatibility cipher. A run includes some automatic tests (see `test/rspec`).

Using the environment (webserver)
-------

* Get on the virtual machine by running `vagrant ssh webserver`.

* A great way to get to know the VMs is to run through the demo's:
 * Basic puppet run [demo/puppet-demo.md](demo/puppet-demo.md)
 * Cipher list selection demo [demo/cipherlist-demo.md](demo/cipherlist-demo.md)
 * Nginx configuration demo [demo/nginx-config-demo.md](demo/nginx-config-demo.md)
 * Vagrant demo [demo/vagrant.md](demo/vagrant.md)


* There is also some provision for manual tests; on the host, port 8080 is forwarded to port 80 on the guest and port 8443 to 443 for webserver. Hence the `http://localhost:8080` and `https://localhost:8443` base URLs can be used in a browser on the host.
* Until the self-signed CA certificate constructed during `vagrant up webserver` is added to the root certificates, browsers complain about the latter base URL. For testing in your browser, you should (temporarly) add the generated ca certificate in your browser. It can be found at `ca/ca_cert.crt`. To add a root certificate in OS X, follow the instructions in http://support.apple.com/kb/PH7297.



Git gotcha
----------

If you are contributing to this project, here is a git nuisance that you need to know about:
the files `ca/serial` and `ca/index.txt` need to exist when running `vagrant up xxx`.
So we put them in the git repository.
But they are changed each time `puppet apply`, and hence `vagrant up`, is run.
Since it is not desirable to check these files in with the new content, you should run 

	git update-index --assume-unchanged ca/index.txt
	git update-index --assume-unchanged ca/serial
